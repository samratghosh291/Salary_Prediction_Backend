# Salary Prediction Flask App

This is a Flask web application for predicting salaries based on years of experience using a trained machine learning model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary_prediction_app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd salary_prediction_app
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have your trained machine learning model saved as `model.pkl` in the `app/` directory.

2. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

3. Access the app in your web browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

4. Enter the years of experience in the input field and click the "Predict" button to get the predicted salary.
